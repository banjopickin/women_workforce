#  Women in the Workforce

## Summary
To study the employment status of women in past two decades and investigate which features determine which women stay in the workforce.

## Motivation
While more talented women are getting higher education, whether this trend results in higher employment rate or satisfaction level among women needs more study. I would like to use data from General Social Survey (GSS) to investigate the employment status among women in past two decades. To further understand women’s motivation to work, a classification model will be implemented to measure which features categorize the women who stay in the workforce. 

## Deliverables
My work will be presented as a report as well as presentation slides. Charts or other
diagrams can visualize the exploratory data analysis results. Flowing data charts will be implemented to show trends of change through history.

## Process
### Employment Status Study
1. Download data about respondents’ employment status, family status and sex. Use this data to answer the following questions. 

2. How did  the employment rate change in past decade? Did women and men display a similar pattern of change?

   * Side by side bar charts 
   
   * t-test
   
3.  Do men and women exhibit the same changes of employment status along with marital and family status changes?
    * charts and Chi-square test.
    
    * find out at which stage women employment rate change most and subset these group of women for further study. 
    
4.  The association between women’s employment status and their level of happiness.

     * Using t-testing on GSS data. Meanwhile, I’ll compare these results with mens’ to see if there’s any difference.
      
### Regression (or classification) Model:

1.   Subset women of different family statuses to show the difference in their employed:unemployed ratios.  Select survey features which reflected their opinions on work and life.

2. Build several regression and classification models, investigate which features are important for women to stay in the workforce.

###Time series Model (If I have time):

1. Build a time series model to answer how many women will join the workforce in next few years.
